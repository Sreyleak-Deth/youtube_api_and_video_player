# youtube_api_and_video_player

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started 
##### When you get started, create "Play YouTube Videos, Access YouTube API, and Get Videos List from Playlist". You need to get all of the points first.
1. YouTube player: https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_player_flutter
2. Http: https://pub.dev/packages/http
3. Cached network image: https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image
4. YouTube Document: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs
5. QuickType Convert JSON into gorgeous, typesafe code in any language: https://quicktype.io/


## Noted:
You need to create one field to store API_KEY:  

#### <ins>lib/utilities/constants/constant.dart</ins>
```
class Constants{
  static const String API_KEY = 'Your Api Key';
}
```
